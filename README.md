## Concept
Agricultural Productivity:
To use Call Detail Record (CDR) data in conjunction with other datasets to monitor and improve agricultural productivity at a granular level. This approach aims to identify mobility patterns in farming areas, rainfall patterns, resource access, and market connectivity, enabling targeted interventions to boost agricultural outputs and sustainability.
Understanding economic activity and income distribution by analyzing communication patterns and correlating them with socioeconomic indicators.


## Data Points
- Identify workforce availability in farming areas using level of subscribers
- Rainfall data (monthly)
- Mobility to commercial areas
- Availability of essential services 
- Farmer-to-extension ratio
- Access to credit
- Arable land area


##Proposed Approach:
###	Data Preparation:
o	Acquire anonymized CDR datasets from Flowminder, Telecel/Vodafone Ghana.
o	Conduct initial preprocessing, feature engineering (e.g., call volume, mobility patterns).
o	Timeframe : 
o	
###	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Visualize communication and mobility patterns across regions and timeframes.
o	Identify trends, anomalies, and correlations with socioeconomic data.
o	
### Analysis Techniques:
o	Clustering: Identify hotspot areas and regions with similar mobility patterns.
o	Time-Series Analysis: Analyze temporal trends in communication or mobility.
o	Mobility Metrics: Calculate key metrics such as radius of gyration, stay duration, and inter-region movement.
o	
###  Visualizations:
o	Interactive dashboards for stakeholders, showing insights like: 
	High-density areas during peak hours.
	Population flow between regions.
	Regions with high mobility indicative of economic activity.
	
### Ethical and Privacy Considerations:
o	Adhere to privacy standards through data anonymization and aggregated reporting.
o	Engage stakeholders to ensure ethical application of findings.
 
## Impact:
### Policy and Planning:
o	Offer actionable recommendations for urban planning, transportation, and health resource allocation.
o	Support evidence-based decision-making at regional and national levels.

### Enhanced Organizational Capacity:
o	Provide training on big data analytics to the Ghana Statistical Service.
o	Serve as a proof-of-concept for using unconventional data sources for public welfare.
### Public Awareness and Collaboration:
o	Collaborate with NGOs, private telecom operators, and academic institutions to build trust and ensure the scalability of the project.
 
## Additional Ideas for Expansion:
### Disaster Recovery Simulations:
o	Use CDR data to model population behavior during simulated disasters to improve emergency response strategies.

### Digital Inclusion:
o	Analyze communication patterns to identify underserved regions with limited telecom activity, informing digital infrastructure investment.

### Sustainability Analysis:
o	Study energy usage patterns indirectly by mapping communication activity to socioeconomic development trends.
